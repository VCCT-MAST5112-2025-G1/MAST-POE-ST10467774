- Tailwind classes → React Native flexbox
- Media queries → Dimensions API
- Hover states → Pressable handlers

### Quality Assurance
- ✅ **0 TypeScript errors** across entire codebase
- ✅ All components use pure React Native APIs
- ✅ No web-specific code remaining
- ✅ Proper TypeScript interfaces for all components
- ✅ Consistent styling patterns
- ✅ Theme support (light/dark mode) functional

### Breaking Changes
⚠️ This is a major version upgrade with breaking changes:

1. **Component APIs** - All props changed from web to React Native patterns
2. **Event Handlers** - Use React Native event types (onPress, onChangeText, etc.)
3. **Styling** - Must use StyleSheet objects instead of className strings
4. **Platform** - Now mobile-only (iOS/Android via Expo)
5. **Dependencies** - All web libraries removed

### Migration Guide
If updating from v1.x:
1. Replace `className` props with `style` props
2. Replace `onClick` with `onPress`
3. Update event handlers to React Native patterns
4. Convert any custom CSS to StyleSheet.create()
5. Test on physical device or emulator
